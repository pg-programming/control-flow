# import some modules so that we get some extra functionality

# ask for the option they would prefer (nth number or number <= n)

# if you recognize their choice then continue

    # ask for the n

    # keep track of the current first and second numbers

    # if we are option number 1 do the nth number algorithm

        # for option 1, loop for n times

            # modify the first and second variables based on new number

        # print the answer

    # if we are option number 2 do the <= n algorithm

        # for option 2, loop while we are <= n

            # modify the first and second variables based on new number

        # print the answer

# otherwise let them know that you didn't understand their choice

# wait for the user to press enter to quit

# clear the console screen
